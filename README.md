## Title: 
##    Hilo Game

## Description: 
##  hilo is a game where the player guesses ,if next card is drawn by   the dealer will be higher or lower than previous one points are   won or lost in respect to player guess.


## project Structure:

## 
The game is an example of abstraction principle of object oriented programming in python.Abstraction tends to hide the complexity of functions and methods to the user by breaking it into simple function.The user has no knowledge of what goes behind the code though he knows what the program does.

## The game is initialized using a constructor __init__ as a fuction with two classes
## class DiceGame and Class HiloGame
## player guesses as he player if the points go lower than  75 points he loses the game

## Example:

##  def __init__(self):   #initialize the game

##        self.score = 300 # player starts with 300 points
##        self.is_playing = True # player is playing
##        self.card = random.randint(1, 13) # current card
##        self.card_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
##        self.card_list_len = len(self.card_list) -->
